# ACS Basic Functions

The AsTeRICS Configuration Suite (ACS) is a web application, which can be run either locally (by simply opening index.html in a webbrowser) or inside a webserver (by entering the respective URL in the webbrowser). Note that the WebACS is currently optimised for usage with Mozilla Firefox 56 or later.

The figure below shows the WebACS after startup. The red numbers point out the most important areas:

1.  Menu
2.  Model Designer: graphical representation of current AsTeRICS model
3.  GUI Designer: graphical editor for runtime user interface
4.  List View: current AsTeRICS model as a list of elements and their interrelations
5.  Property Editor: for adapting the properties of the selected element
