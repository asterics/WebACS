# Keyboard Control

The WebACS is fully accessible via keyboard. The following sections describe the usage in the different parts of the ACS.

## Shortcuts

The shortcut menu right at the top of the screen (see picture below) gives the user the chance to jump directly to one of the subsections of the page, thus making keyboard navigation much faster.

## Model Designer

After jumping to the model designer with _CTRL-2_, the user can enter keyboard mode by pressing _Enter_. Now the components can be navigated by using the _arrow_ keys or moved by using _Shift-Arrow_.  
Pressing the _Space_ bar activates port mode, thus enabling the user to navigate the ports of the selected component via the _arrow_ keys. Pressing _Shift-Space_ on an output port starts drawing a new channel. The user must then navigate to a matching input port on another component and press _Shift-Space_ there to complete the channel. _Esc_ ends port mode.  
When in port mode, the user can activate channel mode by pressing the _Space_ bar again. Now the channels connected to the selected port can be navigated using the _arrow_ keys. _Esc_ ends channel mode.
