# ARE Status

In the bottom left corner the ACS displays the ARE status. Once connected to an ARE, this status actually consists of two parts:

*   the connection status and
*   the synchronisation status.

The connection status can be one of the following:

*   _Disconnected:_ There is no connection to an ARE.
*   _Connected:_ A connection to an ARE has been established.
*   _Model running:_ The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model is running there.
*   _Model paused:_ The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model is paused there.
*   _Model stopped:_ The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model has been stopped there.

The synchronisation status can be either

*   _Synchronised,_ i.e. the model on the ARE is the same as the one selected in the ACS, or
*   _NOT Synchronised,_ i.e. the model on the ARE is different from the one selected in the ACS.
