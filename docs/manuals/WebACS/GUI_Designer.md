# GUI Designer

The GUI Designer allows to arrange the graphical user interfaces (GUI) of those components that have one. These GUI Elements will then be shown on the ARE GUI. GUI elements are drawn and deleted automatically when a component with a GUI is added to or deleted from the model. Within the GUI Designer the size and the position of the GUI Elements can be changed by drag and drop.
