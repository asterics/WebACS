		<h1>ARE Status</h1>
		In the bottom left corner the ACS displays the ARE status. Once connected to an ARE, this status actually consists of two parts:
		<ul>
			<li>the connection status and</li>
			<li>the synchronisation status.</li>
		</ul>
		The connection status can be one of the following: 
		<ul>
			<li><em>Disconnected:</em> There is no connection to an ARE.</li>
			<li><em>Connected:</em> A connection to an ARE has been established.</li>
			<li><em>Model running:</em> The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model is running there.</li>
			<li><em>Model paused:</em> The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model is paused there.</li>
			<li><em>Model stopped:</em> The ACS is connected to an ARE and a model has been stopped there.</li>
		</ul>
		The synchronisation status can be either 
		<ul>
			<li><em>Synchronised,</em> i.e. the model on the ARE is the same as the one selected in the ACS, or</li>
			<li><em>NOT Synchronised,</em> i.e. the model on the ARE is different from the one selected in the ACS.</li>
		</ul>
