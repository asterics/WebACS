		<h1>Keyboard Control</h1>
		<p>The WebACS is fully accessible via keyboard. The following sections describe the usage in the different parts of the ACS.</p>
		<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
		The shortcut menu right at the top of the screen (see picture below) gives the user the chance to jump directly to one of the subsections of the page, thus making keyboard navigation much faster.

		<h2>Menu</h2>
		<p>After jumping to the menu with <em>CTRL-0</em>, the menu tabs can be switched by using the <em>arrow</em> keys. Once the desired tab is active, the menu items can be reached via the <em>Tab</em> key. When one of the component menus in the Components tab is selected, it can also be navigated by using the <em>arrow</em> keys.</p>

		<h2>Model Panel</h2>
		<p>After jumping to the model panel with <em>CTRL-1</em>, the <em>arrow</em> keys can be used to switch between the models.</p>
		<h2>Model Designer</h2>
		<p>After jumping to the model designer with <em>CTRL-2</em>, the user can enter keyboard mode by pressing <em>Enter</em>. Now the components can be navigated by using the <em>arrow</em> keys or moved by using <em>Shift-Arrow</em>.<br />
		Pressing the <em>Space</em> bar activates port mode, thus enabling the user to navigate the ports of the selected component via the <em>arrow</em> keys. Pressing <em>Shift-Space</em> on an output port starts drawing a new channel. The user must then navigate to a matching input port on another component and press <em>Shift-Space</em> there to complete the channel. <em>Esc</em> ends port mode.<br />
		When in port mode, the user can activate channel mode by pressing the <em>Space</em> bar again. Now the channels connected to the selected port can be navigated using the <em>arrow</em> keys. <em>Esc</em> ends channel mode.</p>
