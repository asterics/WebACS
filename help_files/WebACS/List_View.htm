		<h1>List View</h1>
		<p>The List View provides the same model as shown in the Model Designer, but as a list of elements. It is sorted by Sensors, Processors and Actuators. For each component it shows a list of Ports and for each port a list of connections, including a direct link to the connected element. It also contains buttons to connect channels. For example by pressing <em>Start new datachannel</em>, a new datachannel is started. The focus automatically jumps to the <em>Action Pending</em> section at the top of the page, where the pending action is indicated and a <em>Cancel channel</em> button enables the user to continue without completing the channel. However, if the user presses a <em>Connect datachannel here</em> button at a matching input port, the connection is finalised and the channel now exists. This works in the same way for event channels.</p>

		<p>Keyboard users can enter keyboard mode by pressing <em>Enter</em>. Then the user can navigate the elements by using the <em>arrow</em> keys. <em>Space</em> activates port mode, so that the ports of the selected components can be navigated by using the <em>arrow</em> keys. <em>Esc</em> ends port mode.<br />
		When in port mode, the user can activate channel mode by pressing the <em>Space</em> bar again. Now the channels connected to the selected port can be navigated using the <em>arrow</em> keys. <em>Esc</em> ends channel mode.<br />
		The buttons for connecting the channels and for jumping to connected elements can be reached by using the <em>Tab</em> key</p>
