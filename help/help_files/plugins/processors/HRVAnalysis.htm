<H1>HRVAnalysis</H1>
<H3>Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: DSP and feature extraction)</H3>
<p>This component calculates various Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters from an incoming signal of raw ECG-data. 
For a detailed description of the HRV parameters and a guide how to use optical and electrical heart rate sensors see the work 
of Andreas Schreiber (in /documentation/DIYGuides/HRVAnalysis_Schreiber.pdf and /documentation/OpticalPulseSensor_Schreiber.pdf)</p>
