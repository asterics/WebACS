<H3>Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: Basic Math)</H3>
<p>
 The Peakdetector component can be used to detect peaks (top values of the signal) and valleys (bottom values) in a signal. 
 Additionally it can calculate the time between two peaks or two valleys or between a peak and a valley.
 Optionally, top and bottom values can be compared with an average of the most recent top / bottom values - this allows to 
 detect only peaks which are for example greater than 150% of the last 5 averaged peak values.

<H2>Input Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>in [double]:</STRONG> The incoming signal.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Output Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>top:</STRONG> The peak value of the signal.</li>
<li><STRONG>bottom:</STRONG> The bottom value of the signal.</li>
<li><STRONG>time:</STRONG> The time in ms or beats per minute (BPM) (depending on the property timeMode) between two peaks (Mode=detect tops), two valleys (Mode=detect bottoms) or a valley and a peak (Mode=detect both) depending on the selected mode in the properties.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Event Trigger Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>topDetected:</STRONG> The event gets fired if a new top value was detected in the input signal.</li>
<li><STRONG>bottomDetected:</STRONG> The event gets fired if a new bottom value was detected in the input signal.</li>
</ul>
<H2>Properties</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>mode:</STRONG> Determines which time frame will be used for the time output signal (see description of the output port time).</li>
<li><STRONG>comparePeaks:</STRONG>the number of top / bottom values which are taken into account for averaging (0 = disable)</li>
<li><STRONG>validTopPercentage:</STRONG>the percentage of the recent averaged top values which constitutes a valid top value (0 = all top values are valid)</li>
<li><STRONG>validBottomPercentage:</STRONG>the percentage of the recent averaged bottom values which constitutes a valid bottom value (0 = all bottom values are valid)</li>
<li><STRONG>timeMode:</STRONG> Determines the unit for the measured time frame between top/bottom values. Options are beats per minute (BPM) or milliseconds.</li>
