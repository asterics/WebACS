    <h1>Create Encog EG file</h1>
    This document describe how to create sample <a
      href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog"> Encog framework</a> EG
    file that store neural network. The example shown how to create the
    basic neural network that performs XOR operation.
    <ol>
      <li>Download the encog-workbench-3.0.1-release.zip package from
        the <a href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog"> Encog page</a>,
        unzip it and run the Encog Workbench using command: "java -jar
        encog-workbench-3.0.1-executable.jar". Create new folder for the
        project. </li>
      <br>
      <li>To create Neural network, select "File &gt; New file...".
        Select: the "Machine Learning Method (*.eg)" and enter name of
        the EG file. Then, select the "Feedforward Neural Network" and
        click OK. On the next window, enter 2 into the "Input Neuron
        Count" text box. Click Add and enter 4 neurons for the hidden
        layer. enter 1 into the "Output Neuron Count" text box. Change
        the Activation Function Hidden and Activation Function Output to
        the Activation Sigmoid. Then, click OK. </li>
      <br>
      <div class="image"><img src="img/NeuralNetwork.jpg" alt="The
          structure of the neural network" title="The structure of the
          neural network"><br>
        The structure of the neural network</div>
      <br>
      <li>Next step is to create the Training File. Select "File &gt;
        New file...". Select: "Training File (*.egb)" and enter name of
        the EGB file. Click OK. On the next window, enter 4 into the the
        "Training Set Elements" text box, enter 2 into the "Input Field
        Count" text box, enter 1 into the "Output Field Count" text box.
        Click OK. Click on the file and fill the table for the XOR
        operation.</li>
      <br>
      <div class="image"><img src="img/TrainingSet.jpg" alt="The
          training set" title="The training set"><br>
        The training set</div>
      <br>
      <li>When the training set is ready, the neural network can be
        trained. Click on the neural network file and choose the "Train"
        option. In the Training Set select the training file, in the
        Neural Network select the neural network file and click OK.
        Select the Propagation - Resilient (RPROP) training method and
        click OK. Enter 0.01 into the Maximum Error Percent(0-100) box,
        choose the RPROP type: "RPROP+ (classic)" and click OK. Click
        the Start button to Train the network. When the Max Error is
        reached click Close.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    The neural network file can be loaded by the <a
      href="NeuralNetworkLoader.htm"> Neural Network Loader</a>
    plugin.To load the neural network, enter the EG file path into the
    filePath plugin property. For this example, the input1 input port
    and the input2 input port will send the input data for the neural
    network and the output1 output port will give the XOR operation
    result.<br>
