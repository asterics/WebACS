<H1>Blink Detector Trainer</H1>
<H3>Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: DSP and Feature Detection)</H3>
<p>This component calculates the maxThreshold, minThreshold, BlinkLength and DoubleBlinkSeparation customized properties of the <a href="../processors/BlinkDetector.htm">Blink Detector</a> plugin for each specific subject. For a description of the meaning of these properties, please see <a href="../processors/BlinkDetector.htm">Blink Detector</a>.

The training of the system consists on asking the subject to follow a protocol. This protocol consists on a series of 5 simple blinks and 5 double blinks. Note that the subject can perform only <STRONG>one</STRONG> simple (or double) blink each time the protocol indicates so through its Protocol port. When the protocol finishes, the results show up through the Results output port.

<H2>Requirements</H2>
The input signal shall correspond to a 250-Hz sampled electro-oculogram signal, i.e., an output port of the <a href="../sensors/Enobio.htm">Enobio</a> component when the corresponding electrode is placed on the user's forehead.
<H2>Input Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>input [integer]:</STRONG> Input values that correspond to a 250-Hz sampled electro-oculogram signal.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Output Port Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>Protocol [string]:</STRONG> Actions to be performed by the user. Note that the user must perform just one blink (or double blink) each time the corresponding message is delivered through this port.</li>
<li><STRONG>Results [string]:</STRONG> Final parameters calculated for the specific subject. They will delivered when the protocol has finished.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Event Listener Description</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>StartProtocol [integer]:</STRONG> Starts the training protocol. The actions to be performed by the subject will be delivered through the Protocol port.</li>
<li><STRONG>StopProtocol:</STRONG> Stops the training protocol.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Properties</H2>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>sampleRate [integer]:</STRONG> Sample rate of the input signal in Hertz.</li>
<li><STRONG>language [list]:</STRONG> Language of the messages thrown through the Protocol port while the protocol is running. The user can chose English or Spanish.</li>
</ul>
