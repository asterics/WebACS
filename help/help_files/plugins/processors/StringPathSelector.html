    <h1>String Path Selector</h1>
    <h3>Component Type: Processor (Subcategory: Signal Pathways)</h3>
    <p>The StringPathSelector component allows routing of incoming
      strings between up to 4 output ports. The desired output port can
      be directly selected by a dedicated event listener port, or the
      strings can be switched to the next or previous output port. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Input Port Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>in [string]:</strong> The incoming string port to be
        routed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Output Port Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>out1 to out4:</strong> Four output ports where the
        incoming strings can be routed to.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Event Listener Description</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>select1 to select4:</strong> An incoming event at
        these ports directly activates the associated output path (e.g.
        as an event comes in at select 3, the input string port will be
        routed to out3.</li>
      <li><strong>selectNext:</strong> The next output port is selected
        for string output. The maximum number of active ports is set via
        the activePorts property. If the current number is already the
        maximum one, the select next event will wrap around the active
        port number and port 1 will be selected.</li>
      <li><strong>selectPrevious:</strong> The previous output port is
        selected for string output. If the current port is out1, the
        maximum port number (given by the activePorts property) will be
        selected.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>activePorts [integer]:</strong> The maximum port
        number in use (can be 1 to 4).</li>
    </ul>
