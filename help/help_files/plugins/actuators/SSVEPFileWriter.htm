<H1>SSVEP File Writer</H1> 
<H3>Component Type: Actuator (Subcategory: Brain Computer Interface)</H3>
<p>This plugin writes to a text file the 4 EEG channels along with a software trigger received through the event listener ports. This file is lately analyzed by the <a href="../processors/ProtocolSSVEPTrain.htm">ProtocolSSVEPTrain</a> plugin to obtain the optimus frequencies to be used on the SSVEP detection.</p>
