    This document describes how to prepare connection between the
    AndroidPhoneControl component and the AsTeRICSPhoneServer
    application:
    <ol>
      <li>The connection between the AndroidPhoneControl component and
        the AsTeRICSPhoneServer application is made via TCP/IP
        connection. One of these components should work as a server,
        second as the client. The server should have the public IP or it
        should be in the same network where the client is.<br>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>In the model, select the connection mode in the connetionType
        property of the AndroidPhoneControl component. If the component
        should work as a server, put into the port property, the port
        which server will be use for its service. If the component
        should work as a client, put into the IP property IP of the
        server and into the port property the server port.<br>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Run the Android Server application on the Android phone.
        Select the connection mode from the Connection type property. If
        the application should work as a server put into the port number
        property the port which server will be use for its service. If
        the application should work as a client put into the Server IP
        property IP of the server and into the Port Number property the
        server port.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If the AndroidPhoneControl component is set to work as the
        server and Android Server application is set to work as client.
        First run the model, then, enable Android application using
        Enable server property. If Android Server application is set to
        work as a server and the AndroidPhoneControl component is set to
        work as a client first enable the Android application then run
        the model.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
