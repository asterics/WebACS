    <h1>CellBoard</h1>
    <h3>Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory: Graphical User Interface)</h3>
    <p>The CellBoard plugin is a GUI plugin which can display a panel
      with multiple cells. It can be used as a simple on-screen keyboard. 
	  Each cell can contain text and a picture, and it
	  can provide acoustic feedback on selection. Cells can emit command strings and sounds or switch to other 
	  cellboards (which can be stored as .xml files). The CellBoard plugin provides 
	  basic scanning options (to select a cell via a stepwise process). It also provides
	  a small editor for designing the cells and saving the whole cellboard grid as an .xml file.</p>

    <h2>Using the cell editor</h2>

    <p>The cell editor can be opened by right-clicking a cell. (This option can be enabled/disabled by using the 
	property "enableEdit"). The cell editor allows to define the content of a cell (cell caption, action string, 
	cell image and sounds for cell-selection or acoustic preview during cell scanning). "Switch to Cellboard" allows
	to specify a cellboard grid which will be loaded when this cell is selected. When "back" is entered here, the
	previously loded cellboard will be restored. Thus, complex communication/selection grids can be layered. The whole current
	cellboard is saved as an .xml file when "Save Cellboard" is clicked. Existing .xml files can be selected to be loaded on startup
    via the "keyboardFile"-property of the cellboard plugin in the ACS property editor. </p>

      <li><strong>scanMode [integer]:</strong> This property defines the
        scanning mode:
        <ul>
          <li><em>"none":</em> The board is not scanned. Users can
            select the cell by clicking on it.</li>
          <li><em>"row-column":</em> In this mode, rows of the cells are
            scanned. When the user selects the row, cells in the row are
            scanned. The scanning frame can be moved using the scanMove
            event port. The row and the cell itself can be selected
            using the scanSelect event port.</li>
          <li><em>"column-row":</em> In this mode, columns of the cells
            are scanned. When the user selects the column, cells in the
            column are scanned. The scanning frame can be moved using
            the scanMove event port. The column and the cell itself can
            be selected using the scanSelect event port.</li>
          <li><em>"directed":</em> In this mode only one cell is
            highlighted. The user can move the scan highlighting via the
            moveUp, moveRight, moveLeft or moveDown event ports or the
            row, cellNumber and column input ports. The cell can be
            selected using the scanSelect event port.</li>
          <li><em>"hover selection":</em> In this mode the user can
            select the cell by hovering the mouse pointer above the
            cell.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
	  
      <li><strong>scanCycles [integer]:</strong> This parameter is used
        in "row/column scanning" mode. After the number of scan cycles
		is reached, the scanning switches back to the highest level.</li>
      <li><strong>hoverTime [integer]:</strong> This parameter is used
        in "hover selection" mode. It defines the time of hovering
        needed to select the cell (in milliseconds).</li>
      <li><strong>hoverTimeIndicator [integer]:</strong> This parameter 
	  adjusts the way a hover selection prgress is indicated to the user:
		        <ul>
          <li><em>"fixed frame":</em> No graphical indication - the frame of the 
		    currently active cell is shown but does not change.</li>
          <li><em>"growing frame":</em> The frame of the active cell is growing
		    until the value of property "hoverSelectionThickness" is reached - then
			the cell is selected.</li>
          <li><em>"backgorund color":</em> The background color of the cell changes slowly
			from the selected "backgroundColor" to the selected "scanColor" - then the cell
			is selected.</li>
        </ul>
		</li>
		
      <li><strong>hoverFrameThickness [integer]:</strong> Maximum thickness of the cell frame
	  (only valid for the hover selection mode with indicator "growing frame").
	  </li>
      <li><strong>enableEdit [boolean]:</strong> If selected, the cells can be
	  right-clicked to display the cell editor, which also allows to save the xml-keyboard file.
	  </li>
      <li><strong>enableClickSelection [boolean]:</strong>If selected, all cells can be selected
	  via a left click, regardless of the scanning process</li>
      <li><strong>commandSeparator [string]:</strong>If a character (or characters) are specified here,
	  they will be used to tokenize the cell text which is sent to the "selectedCellText" output port when teh cell is selected.
	  This can be used to send multiple strings (seperately) to this output port. In the example screenshot above,
	  a semicolon (";") is used to send two different action string to the output port when the cell is selected.
	  A "StringFilter" plugin can then be used to route these commands to different plugins.</li>
      <li><strong>keyboardFile [string]:</strong> Name of a cellboard .xml file 
	  (the sugeested files are located in folder data/cellBoardKeyboards or in folder "models"). This file will be loaded 
	  at startup of the model. If no file is specified, only the cell contents defined via the ACS editor
	  will be available.<b>Supports value suggestions 
	  for existing xml-files from the ARE (dynamic property)</b></li>
      <li><strong>ignoreKeyboardFileProperties [boolean]:</strong> If selected, the general cellboard parameters 
	  (rows/columns/colors/scan mode etc.) will be kept as defined via the ACS editor when a cellboard .xml file is loaded.
	  If not selected, these parameters will be loaded from the .xml file, thereby overriding the values defined in the ACS editor.</li>
      <li><strong>dispayGUI [boolean]:</strong> If selected, the component
	  will be displayed in the ARE GUI. Otherwise the componentent will be hidden !</li>
	  <p>The following properties will be overwritten if cellboard .xml files are loaded:</p>

      <li><strong>cellText1...cellText36 [string]:</strong> The text
        displayed on the cell.</li>
      <li><strong>cellImage1...cellImage36 [string]:</strong> The path
        of the image displayed on the cell.</li>
      <li><strong>actionText1...actionText36 [string]:</strong> The text
        sent through the selectedCellText output port, when the cell is
        selected.</li>
    </ul>
