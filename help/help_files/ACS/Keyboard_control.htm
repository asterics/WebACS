<h3>The Context Menu</h3>
<ul>
	<li><EM>Add Channel</EM> creates a new channel. An output port must be selected to initiate a new channel.</li> 
	<li><EM>Connect Channel</EM> sets the end point of the new channel. Select an empty input port to finish the channel</li> 
	<li><EM>Drop Channel</EM> deletes an initiated but unfinished channel</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><EM>Add Event Channel</EM> creates a new event channel. An event trigger must be selected to initiate a new event channel.</li> 
	<li><EM>Connect Event Channel</EM> sets the end point of the new event channel. Select an event listener to finish the event channel. Afterwards, the events must be set in the Event Editor</li> 
	<li><EM>Drop Event Channel</EM> deletes an initiated but unfinished event channel</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><EM>Move Selection</EM> moves the selected elements on the drawing area by using the arrow keys. The move operation can be stopped by pressing <em>Enter</em>. </li> 
	<li><EM>Delete Selection</EM> deletes the selected components, channels and event channels.</li>

	<li><EM>Remove Conflict Marker</EM> removes the marker, indicating a version conflict between the component collection of the ARE and the ACS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The GUI Editor</h2>
<p>
Accessing the GUI Editor is quite similar to the Drawing area. Using the <em>Ctrl</em>+<em>G</em> key combination sets the focus on the first element. The <em>App</em> Key (also called Context Menu key) opens the context menu, 
offering the options of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><EM>Resize</EM> chnages the width and hight of the GUI element by using the arrow keys.</li> 
	<li><EM>Stop Resize</EM> stops the resize operation. This function will automatically be called if the focus is set to any other element (e.g by pressing the <em>Tab</em> or the <em>App</em> key). </li> 
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><EM>Move</EM> moves the GUI element on the GUI area by using the arrow keys.</li> 
	<li><EM>Stop Move</EM> stops the move operation. This function will automatically be called if the focus is set to any other element (e.g by pressing the <em>Tab</em> or the <em>App</em> key).</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Property and Port Editor</h2>
<p><em>Ctrl</em>+<em>G</em> sets the focus to the property editor tab. Using the <em>Tab</em> key sets the focus to the property editor, using the arrow keys allows to navigate to the other tabs 
(input and output ports, event triggers and listeners). Within the property editor, navigation will be handled using the <em>Tab</em> key to select and edit the different properties. Within the input and output ports, 
the list of ports can be navigated using the arrow keys (so shown in screenshot 4). </p>

<h2>Event Editor</h2>
<p>With the Event Editor (reachable with the shortcut <em>Ctrl</em>+<em>E</em>), events within an event channel will be set. Once again, the navigation will be handled using the <em>Tab</em> key. When a combobox is in focus, 
the value can be changed using the up an down arrow keys. Furthermore, the combobox can be opend using the <em>Enter</em> key. Screenshot 5 shows the event editor with an opend combo box.</p>
