<h1>Disconnected</h1>
<p>This is the standard mode after the ACS has been started. The drawing area is enabled, new components can be added and channels between the components can be established. Models cannot be uploaded or downloaded and also the ARE storage is not accessible, due to the fact that there is no ARE connected.</p>
