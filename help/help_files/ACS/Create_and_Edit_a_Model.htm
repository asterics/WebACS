<h1>Create and Edit a Model</h1>
<p>To create a new model, add one or several components. To do so, select the tab Components, and from the sub-menu select a group of components, depending on what is supposed to be added. The three component groups are <em>Sensors</em>, <em>Processors</em> and <em>Actuators</em>.
Within these sections, the components are devided in subsections, making it easier finding one plugin out of the hugh amount of available plugins. Additionally, there is a fifth section <em>Saved Groups</em> where saved groups can be added to the drawing. </p>

<p>Now, this added component can be manipulated in the drawing area. This can be done with the functions in the Edit-tab or directly by using the mouse or the keyboard.
</p>
<h2>Model Manipulation via Mouse</h2>
<p>After a component has been added to the drawing field, it can be moved by using the drag and drop functionality. Several elements (components, channels, eventchannels) can be selected by drawing a selection rectangle (just press the left mouse button and move the mouse) or by pressing the <em>Ctrl</em>-Key and clicking on each element.
All the selected elements can be also moved using drag and drop. All selected components are marked with a blue rectange in the background, the component, which has the keyboard focus (and displayed in the property editor), is surrounded with a blue border. Channels can be drawn by pressing the mouse button over an output port and dragging the channel to an input port. Connecting eventchannels is similar to the channels.</p>

<h2>Model Manipulation via Keyboard</h2>
<p>
All elements within the drawing area can be set on focus, using the <em>Tab</em>-key or the arrow-keys. To select an element, the <em>Space</em>-key has to be used, to select several elements, use <em>Ctrl-</em> and <em>Space</em>-Keys at the same time. By pressing the <em>Alt<em>-Key, the ribbon menu shortcuts will appear at the menus. The <em>App</em>-Key opens the context menu. More information about the usage of the keyboard within the ACS can be found in the section <em>Component Context Menu</em>.  
</p>
<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>It is possible to select several components, channels and event channels at the same time. The selection can be made with the mouse (by dragging a selection rectangle or by the usage of the <em>Ctrl</em>-key, like in many standard programs) or with the keyboard using the <em>Space</em> key. The selected components are marked with a blue frame. The figure below shows a model with several selected components.</p>
